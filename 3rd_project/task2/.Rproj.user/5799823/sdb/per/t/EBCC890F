What is a Bayes classifier, Bayes decision boundary and Bayes error rate?\n\nThe Bayes classifier is a classifier that is based on the conditional probability \n\n$$\nPr(Y=j|X=x_{0}).\n$$\nThe classifier assigns observation $x_0$ to the class $j$ with the largest such probability. For instance, in a two-class situation, the classifier will assign the observation $x_0$ to the class with $$Pr(Y=j|X=x_0)>0.5$$.\n\nBayes decision boundary is the class boundaries where the Bayes classifier's prediction is determined. Continuing with the two-class problem, the Bayes decision boundary will be the set of points in $$\\mathbb{R}^2$$ where the conditional probability is exactly 50% for each class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
